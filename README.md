<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[Privnote](https://github.com/alexdatur/privnote) is a secure, open-source note sharing service inspired by PrivNote. This project is unique because it's built with Svelte but emits zero JavaScript, ensuring a lightweight and fast user experience. The backend is powered by Axum, a highly performant web application framework.

This fork enhances the original project by adding Docker support for easy deployment.

Here's why you should consider using or contributing to Privnote:

- It's secure: Your notes are safe and can be shared confidently.
- It's efficient: With zero JavaScript emission from Svelte and a performant backend in Axum, Privnote is built for speed.
- It's open-source: This means you can contribute to its development, suggest changes, and help improve it.
- It's Docker-ready: Easy to deploy in any environment with Docker.

Privnote is not just another note sharing service. It's designed to be secure, efficient, and user-friendly.

### Built With

The major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap this project include:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): A language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/): A framework for building extremely high-performance web apps.
- [SeaORM](https://www.sea-orm.org/): An async, dynamic and lightweight ORM for Rust.
- [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum): A web application framework that ensures high performance.
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/): A JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. In this project, it's configured to emit zero JavaScript.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): A powerful, open source object-relational database system.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): For containerization and easy deployment.

Nginx Configuration

For production deployment, it's recommended to use Nginx as a reverse proxy. Below is a sample configuration:
nginx

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name yourdomain.xyz;

    ssl_certificate /yourpath/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /yourpath/privkey.pem;
    
    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
    add_header X-Robots-Tag noindex;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
    

    location / {
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/;
    }
